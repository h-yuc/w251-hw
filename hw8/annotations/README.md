## Part 1: Image Annotation

1.	In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?  

**I annotated 364 images.**

2.	Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate?  How many TIE Fighters?

**TIE Fighters:274, Millennium Falcon: 279.**

3.	Based on this experience,  how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?

**It's tedious. Won't recommand to do it for large image dataset. If possible, can use the dataset in recaptcha, which sends images to users and ask users to identify the location of item.**

4.	Think about image augmentation?  How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?

**Image augmentation will affect the location and quality of the annotated objects.**

## Part 2: Image Augmentation

1. Describe the following augmentations in your own words
-	Flip

**Flip transforms the image like mirrors. Horizontal flip mirrors the image with a vertical line through image center and 
vertical flip mirrors the image with a horizontal line through image center.**

- Rotation

**Rotation rotates the image at an angle.**

-	Scale

**Scale resizes the image to larger or smaller.**

-	Crop

**Crop cuts/selects only part of the image.**

-	Translation

**Translation shifts image to a size specified in x-axis and y-axis.**

-	Noise

**Noise adding random noise to the image to reduce the overfitting features.**

## Part 3: Audio Annotation

1.	Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation? 

**Time and frequency waveform are needed for an audio annotation.**
