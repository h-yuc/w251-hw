What an arrogant piece of shit. This arrogant piece of garbage isn't worthy to collect dog feces, let alone be elected to an office that Alaskans have to pay for. Those that elected him seriously need to re-think their values. And we wonder why our state is in the physical shape we are in.

NO , massive tax increases on businesses means they wont invest and that hurts the economy. More on the wealthy? you are not satisfied that they already pay a huge portion of all taxes? how much should the be taxed, 100 % then? wow jealousy or what! 

now income tax cuts means more money in the economy right away and that means a growing economy which means MORE NET tax revenue for governments as it has happened every time such has been done here and in the usa! it happened when mike harris did it, when reagan did it and yes even when John F kennedy did it!

Trump is a mentally unbalanced buffoon.
He's unfit for office.
He's the largest threat to our nation's security and Congress should exercise it's responsibility and remove him now.
He's a petty con man, a racist supremacist, a sexual predator and a traitor.
Worst ever.

Good idea too have begun your comment with a conditional clause, because that is precisely what a number of readers of your comment are asking: namely, is your motivation really seeking the greatest good for a certain group of people ... ?  

Of course, you will say "Yes I am". Trouble is, there is room to wonder whether that is borne out by the content of your comments.
